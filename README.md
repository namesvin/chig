# chig - chat i guess
welcome to my ~~first actally serious~~ personal project, chig, a chat app.

backend written in python using flask and sqlite,

frontend written in pure html, css and javascript (fuck react users :100:)

## small warning
this app binds to localhost which is a very bad idea, do not use a development server for anything != development

## requirements
- sqlite3
- flask *along with*
- flask_cors, flask_socketio, flask_session

## setup
create a chigsec.py file and define
- *key*, for your secret key
- *inv*, for your always valid invite
- *clear*, for your db clear key

congrats, you can now simply run the main.py file

## q&a
**should i run an instance of this?**

no there are probably thousands of rce exploits in this somehow

**why did you make a chat app**

i wanted to see if i could

**something is broken what do**

fix it and submit pr, i'm a dumbass lol

**why does the readme suck so much**

it's 2:47am leave me the fuck alone
